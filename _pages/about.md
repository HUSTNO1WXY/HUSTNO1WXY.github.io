I‚Äôm a second-year Ph.D. student at VLISLab, Nagoya University, interested in high-level CV topics from detection to segmentation vision.

Prior to Nagoya University, I obtained my B.ENG and M.ENG in Information and Communication Engineering from Northeastern University (NEU), where I focused on medical image analysis.

Lately, I‚Äôve been focusing on Open-Vocabulary Vision tasks.
