Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D. student supervised by [Daisuke Deguchi](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=OO215U0AAAAJ) and [Hiroshi Murase](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=T2O1-JgAAAAJ) at [VisLab](https://www.vislab.is.i.nagoya-u.ac.jp), Nagoya University, interested in CV topics from local feature matching to visual place recognition.

Prior to Nagoya University, I obtained my B.ENG in Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT) and M.ENG in Southeast University (SEU), where I focused on local feature matching.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been focusing on efficient and effective feature matching algorithms and its application, such as visual place recognition. My [CV](My_CV.pdf) can be downloaded here.
